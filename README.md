# DMC
A radio interferometric imaging tool that utilizes the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo framework provided by PyMC3.  The framework employed here has the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in mind, and relies heavily on the eht-imaging library for VLBI data manipulation.

NOTE: Currently still in testing mode, so no guarantees that code will work at all yet.
